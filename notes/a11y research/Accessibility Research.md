## [Patterns for accessible web chat](https://accessibility.blog.gov.uk/2016/12/09/patterns-for-accessible-webchats/)

Post from 2016.
Focused on accessiblity through the lens of screen readers.

### Key Findings
Use labels. Use them a lot.
Add hidden labels to message submission button.

Use [[aria-live]] regions to wrap sections of the chat. There seems to be slightly different implementations of this per accessibilty client.

Use [skiplinks](https://webaim.org/techniques/skipnav/) to help users navigate.

- lots of being overwhelmed by interface or volume of messages
- struggle to understand how to find someone to talk to
- asks specific people for help

## Screen Readers
On MacOS (where I'm developing), the built-in [[VoiceOver]] is the top one.
NVDA could be a good second for later.
