The point of this hackathon is to:
1. Understand more about accessibilty when related to chat clients
2. Test out supabase/postgres as a store for chat messages

(1) is related to my day job and a personal interest.
(2) is something that I've been waiting for an excuse to do for a while now but never had a clear enough idea to get properly into it.

## Constraints
### Time
The hackathon runs from the 1st of October until the 10th (11:59PM PT = 19:59 BST). It's already 20:35 BST on the 4th by the time I've started this.

I have a day job as a software engineer. I don't want to spend more than an hour a night doing this on top of everything else. I don't work Wednesdays so that might be a little catch up time... I'll probably be outside instead.

### Skills
I have limited knowledge of accessibility requirements in chat scenarios.
I have limited/no current knowledge of supabase.

I'll have to stick to things that have sensible defaults and play into the typescript ecosystem (I'm both comfortable with it and aware that it has great support in supabase).

## Tech Choices
Supabase (obviously).
Next.js with heavy use of SSR - this should keep the focus on accessible markup that I can re-use across the UI components.
Figma.

These are all things that I'm fairly familiar with and should give me sensible defaults.
*Maybe I can make use of the gov.uk HTML components for a leg up...?*

## [[Accessibility Research]]
Out of time for more than the above.
