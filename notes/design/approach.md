Time is extremely constrained here so I'm going to have to narrow the scope of what I'm going after. To re-iterate the major goal it's to:

> Create a full chat stack that is widely accessible.

Accessibility is the name of the game but it means lots of things to different audiences. I like the Social Model of Accessibility framing that describes how we're all disabled by our environment at different times and in different ways. To this end, I'll have to choose *who* is being disabled, *where this occurs* and *how to fix it*.

As for who: I'm going to target people over 40 and under 70 years old. This gives me a nice constraint for my first [[User Persona]].

The specific accessibilty problems they often face are:
- not being able to find things that they need to operate the chat service
- not being able to select some smaller buttons/links etc.

They send messages that are nearly totally text.

They don't think of channels organised by topic, but by collection of people.

They often would rather speak to one person by chat and multiple people in person or over the phone, where interaction is limited to one voice at a time.

## Out of scope
1. a11y issues with mobile keyboards (mostly to do with size)
2. non-text media

## Priorities
1. Super easy sign up
2. Direct messages to other people
3. Simple, easy to understand visual interface
4. Simple, easy to understand voice-over interface

## Stretch
1. Mediated groups where the volume of messages is constrained
