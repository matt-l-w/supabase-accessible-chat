# supabase-accessible-chat

See the [notes](/notes) directory for a markdown collection of notes as I
go through the hackathon.

For those of you that use [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/), you can open it
as a vault and get nice links/rendering.

# Day Log
## 21/10/04
Time spent: 1hr
Started the hackathon with a bit of research.
Ideas are forming about what to target in the week... Right now I'm thinking
that getting the basics of rooms and chat messages to be accessible will be
more than enough for the time.

Day two should get some wireframes in so I know what to aim for/refer to.
There's an outstanding question about whether the gov.uk UI components might
be helpful or not. This should be easy to work out tomorrow.
